# Week 2: Tackle Overfitting with Data Augmentation

Welcome to this assignment! As in the previous week, you will be using the famous `cats vs dogs` dataset to train a model that can classify images of dogs from images of cats. For this, you will create your own Convolutional Neural Network in Tensorflow and leverage Keras' image preprocessing utilities, more so this time around since Keras provides excellent support for augmenting image data.

You will also need to create the helper functions to move the images around the filesystem as you did last week, so if you need to refresh your memory with the `os` module be sure to take a look a the [docs](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html).

Let's get started!

Code the `split_data` function which takes in the following arguments:
- SOURCE_DIR: directory containing the files

- TRAINING_DIR: directory that a portion of the files will be copied to (will be used for training)

- VALIDATION_DIR: directory that a portion of the files will be copied to (will be used for validation)

- SPLIT_SIZE: determines the portion of images used for training.

The files should be randomized, so that the training set is a random sample of the files, and the validation set is made up of the remaining files.

For example, if `SOURCE_DIR` is `PetImages/Cat`, and `SPLIT_SIZE` is .9 then 90% of the images in `PetImages/Cat` will be copied to the `TRAINING_DIR` directory
and 10% of the images will be copied to the `VALIDATION_DIR` directory.

All images should be checked before the copy, so if they have a zero file length, they will be omitted from the copying process. If this is the case then your function should print out a message such as `"filename is zero length, so ignoring."`. **You should perform this check before the split so that only non-zero images are considered when doing the actual split.**


Hints:

- `os.listdir(DIRECTORY)` returns a list with the contents of that directory.

- `os.path.getsize(PATH)` returns the size of the file

- `copyfile(source, destination)` copies a file from source to destination

- `random.sample(list, len(list))` shuffles a list

Now that you have successfully organized the data in a way that can be easily fed to Keras' `ImageDataGenerator`, it is time for you to code the generators that will yield batches of images, both for training and validation. For this, complete the `train_val_generators` function below.

Something important to note is that the images in this dataset come in a variety of resolutions. Luckily, the `flow_from_directory` method allows you to standarize this by defining a tuple called `target_size` that will be used to convert each image to this target resolution. **For this exercise use a `target_size` of (150, 150)**.

One last step before training is to define the architecture of the model that will be trained.

Complete the `create_model` function below which should return a Keras' `Sequential` model.

Aside from defining the architecture of the model, you should also compile it so make sure to use a `loss` function that is compatible with the `class_mode` you defined in the previous exercise, which should also be compatible with the output of your network. You can tell if they aren't compatible if you get an error during training.

**Note that you should use at least 3 convolution layers to achieve the desired performance.**
